  <h2> <u>
    Building Suspense with "Show, Don't Tell"
  </u>
  </h2>
  <h4><i>

  <p>
    Whether you’re a novice or a professional screenwriter, there’s no doubt you’re familiar with the term “show, don’t tell.” This phrase has become a constant in industry terminology — only because it’s one of the most important writing skills you should carry in your screenwriter’s toolbox.
  </p>
  
  <p>“Show, don’t tell” is a screenwriting technique that reveals information to the audience through a character’s actions, rather than exposition (or wordy dialogue). We are shown the information, rather than told what is happening.
  </p>
  
  <p>This tool can be particularly helpful when writing your suspense, thriller, or horror script. “Show, don’t tell” is a powerful device for creating anticipation, fabricating mystery, and hooking the reader from the first page.
  </p>
  
  <p>Cinema is a visual medium and the proper use of “show, don’t tell” gives us a clear visual sense of what the story looks like and effectively creates more suspense in your screenplay.
  </p>
  
  <h3><b><u>Build Anticipation
  </u></b></h3>
  
  <p>Steven Spielberg’s infamous Jaws (1975) is riddled with great examples of visual language. In the opening scene of the film, our monster is never revealed as a shark. The writers used visual language such as a gentle bulge in the water and the churning froth of a baby whirlpool to describe the horrific murder scene.
  </p>
  
  <p>On the page, we can see the mysterious details of the attack. This is much more powerful to read than if the writers wrote a shark attacks Chrissie. Using rich, descriptive language creates a more vivid picture and builds suspense in the reader’s mind.
  </p>
  
  <h3><b><u>Create Mystery
  </u></b></h3>
  
  <p>Presenting visual clues leading up to a big reveal is a great way to add tension and create mystery in your screenplay. Crime thrillers and murder mysteries are perfect examples of this.
  </p>
  
  <p>In Knives Out (2019), the lead detective gathers mysterious clues throughout the entire movie, such as footprints in the dirt and supposedly meaningless cutaway shots, like blood on a shoe. The reader can put these clues together with the character. Not only does this add to the mystery, but it also provides a significant reward for the reader when they can solve the case on their own.
  </p>
  
  <p>Show the audience the information to move the plot forward, rather than tell them how to solve the mystery.
  </p>
  
  <h3><b><u>Keep the Reader Engaged
  </u></b></h3>
  
  <p>Too much exposition can take the reader out of the story. It’s much more compelling to reveal information through visuals than dialogue. This technique quickens the pacing and keeps the reader engaged.
  </p>
  
  <p>In Jaws, the characters don’t have to tell the audience how dangerous the water is. Every time they enter the ocean, we can feel the anxiety building within us. Whenever the beast is described as lurking in the water, we anticipate and dread his next attack.
  </p>
  
  <p>In another haunting scene, a young boy is attacked by the monstrous shark on the beach. We don’t see the action happening. Instead, we see his shredded yellow raft wash ashore. A tinge of murky red also mixes in with the foam of the waves. Without being told of his unfortunate end, we can put the results of the scene together strictly through visual language.
  </p>
  
  <p>If the writers only wrote that the shark attacks the young boy, there’s less mystery to keep us engaged. Don’t be blunt with the reader. String them along with visual clues. They’ll thank you for it.
  </p>
  
  <p>Today’s audiences are smart. Revealing information through visual language helps them dive deeper into the story, experience the anticipation of a scene, and create mysteries for the reader to solve.
  </p>
  
  <p>Show us what we see on the screen, don’t tell us. If you reveal your story to the audience using this technique, your script will breathe suspenseful and rewarding cinematic language.

  <h2><u>
    Pitfalls to Evade as a Beginner Screenwriter
  </u>
  </h2>
  <h3><i>Read more, type less</i></h3>
  <h4><i>
    By Twich Collins
  </i></h4>
  
  <p>I believe that everyone has it in them to tell a moving and compelling story. Be it a personal story about authentic experiences you have gone through or ones where everything is a fantasy, and the characters bear no resemblance to you or others you know. </p>
  
  <p>With proper study, guidance, and willingness to get it done, anyone can write a script. Will you be as good as the great and powerful Aaron Sorkin? Potentially. I know I probably won’t, but you may.</p>
  
  <p>	However, when some venture into the world of screenwriting, they fall into common tropes that they believe are needed in their stories. Trust me, I know from experience and have the evidence to back it up. I should probably burn the evidence, but I’m sentimental and don’t throw away any writing, no matter how bad it is. And there is some pretty trash fire-worthy stuff.
  </p>
  
  <p>	What you’ll find in this series are those pitfalls to avoid that seem like they are an absolute necessity to tell your story. Don’t get me wrong, in some instances, they may be, but for the sake of learning to crawl before you try out for the marathon, learn the fundamentals and principles of the craft first.
  </p>
  
  <h3><b><u>Type Less
  </u></b></h3>
  
  <p>	The first pitfall we’ll tackle is “where to start?” Some people tend to jump in, open a blank document, and start typing away. The problem is that some don’t even know what a proper script looks like. I know this for a fact on two fronts. The first is my journey into screenwriting. The first “script” I ever tried to write looked more like a bastardized version of a stage play. It looked and sounded nothing like an actual screenplay. I started typing before I even saw what a script looked like. 
  </p>
  
  <p>	The second reason I know this is after almost a decade of script and development consulting, I have seen countless “scripts” from first-time writers that looked like my first attempt or worse. 
  </p>
  
  <p>	Their first script, along with my own, wasn’t formatted remotely close to a proper screenplay. It’s as bad as single lines of dialogue with no action/description to give any context to what is being seen, and drafts that look like giant blocks of text with no scene headings or separate lines for dialogue. The documents were usually written in a word processor and not screenwriting software. Mine included.
  </p>
  
  <p>	Now I’m not throwing shade on these writers. I leaped before I looked too. I didn’t know anyone in the story world, so I started trying to tell my story until I realized I was heading down the wrong path.
  </p>
  
  <h3><b><u>Read More
  </u></b></h3>
  
  <p>	So how do you avoid ending up on that path? The solution is simple. Read as many scripts as you can get your hands on. Start with scripts of movies you are familiar with. See how the words were translated into moving pictures on the screen. Look into scripts from writers that have stood the test of time. You can find a list of good screenplays to start with HERE.
  </p>
  
  <p>	It’ll not just show you how a screenplay is formatted, which is a key component in starting in this world, but show you how and why the stories work. It’ll get you familiar with how they show the story through action and not tell it, how they introduce conflict into a scene, and how they use structure to keep the story balanced and reveal the turns of the characters.
  </p>
  
  <p>However, once you’ve started to familiarize yourself with how a screenplay should look and read, don’t just stick with the Spike Lees, Diablo Codys, Steven Soderberghs, Peter Hedges, or the Aline Brosh McKennas, although absolutely read “The Devil Wears Prada.” It’s amazing!
  </p>
  
  <p>	Read the mediocre and bad scripts as well. You’ll learn valuable lessons from all of them. It will teach you how to recognize weaknesses in your own writing. You’ll be able to juxtapose between good and bad pacing, poorly written characters, and well-crafted dynamic ones, and how the writer uses their voice to tell the story to keep you engaged over just giving directions to put the story together.
  </p>
  
  <p>	If it seems like homework, it kind of is. But whoever said homework had to be dull was a liar. If storytelling is a passion for you and you’d like to see your characters come to life, this is the best place to start. You’ll save yourself a lot of headaches, and you’ll get better feedback. Plus, you’ll start on a better path than I did.
