<h1>
    About Us
</h1>

<p>FADE IN: to FADE OUT. is my favorite term in all of screenwriting. It’s how the writing process starts and how it ends. They are the four words I look forward to typing the most in any story I create. FADE IN: means the beginning of my journey into a new world, and that continues until I get to FADE OUT.</p>

<p>It’s a hard, unforgiving journey and takes so much effort to trek, but it’s also beautiful, cathartic, and awe-inspiring. That’s what life as a storyteller is like. It can be difficult and make you feel like you have failed, but if storytelling is in your soul, there is no other journey for you.</p>

<p>I fully believe that everyone has a story within them. Some feel that pull and need to tell that story, but they don’t know how to get the story that’s inside out.  They don’t know how to start that journey. Which is why we are here.</p>

<p>We hope to be a resource to educate on what it takes to be a writer. To give you the tools to fill your toolbox and how to use those tools to become proficient in the screenwriting craft. We want to be a part of that journey and give you our expertise.</p>

<p>Our goal is to help you tell the best story you can. We are here to get you from FADE IN: to FADE OUT.</p>
